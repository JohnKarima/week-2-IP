# Project name 
Akan Calculator.

## Author 
Created by John Karima.

## About 
A project consisting of an Akan calculator which takes in a date input and returns the corresponding Akan male/female name and day of the week. This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Setup Instructions 
- Clone the repository 
```
$ git clone Week-1-IP
```
- Move into directory 
```
$ cd Week-2-IP
```
- Open project on code editor 
```
$ code . 
```
- Run the project on Live Server

## BDD
- The project should validate and accept user input.
- It should pass the validated input into Zeller's congruence.
- It should then use the result of the algorthm to access and return the corresponding day of the week and the Akan name that goes with said date.

## Technologies Used
Zeller's congruence, an algorithm by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. It can be used to determine the day of the week for any date in the past, present or future, for any dates between 1582 and 4902.
